# Word Counter Challenge

Welcome to the Word Counter Challenge! In this challenge, you will be working with the provided Python code to implement the logic for counting words and word frequencies in a file. Your task is to complete the code by filling in the missing parts and achieve the desired functionality.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `word_counter.py` file in your preferred Python editor or IDE.
3. Read through the comments in the code to understand the structure and purpose of the functions.
4. Implement the logic for counting words in the `count_words` function. This function should count the total number of words in a file and return an integer representing the count.
5. Implement the logic for counting word frequencies in the `count_word_frequencies` function. This function should count the frequency of each word in the file and return a dictionary with the word frequencies. The keys of the dictionary should be the words, and the values should be the corresponding frequencies.
6. In the `main` function, call the `count_words` and `count_word_frequencies` functions with the file path provided by the user.
7. Display the total number of words to the user by printing the count returned by the `count_words` function.
8. Display the word frequency count to the user by iterating over the dictionary returned by the `count_word_frequencies` function and printing each word along with its frequency.
9. Test your code with different files to ensure it works correctly.

## Submission

Once you have completed the challenges, you can submit your solution by pushing your changes to the repository. Make sure to include any additional files or modifications you made during the process.

## Evaluation

Your solution will automatically be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correct implementation of the word counting logic.
- Correct implementation of the word frequency counting logic.
- Proper integration of the functions in the `main` function.
- Accurate display of the total number of words and word frequency count.
- Clean and well-structured code.

Remember, the focus of this challenge is on your understanding and implementation of the provided code. Avoid searching for direct solutions or copying code from external sources. Use this opportunity to practice your problem-solving skills and demonstrate your understanding of Python programming concepts.

Good luck with the challenge! If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out.
